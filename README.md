A simple gui to interact with Stable Video Diffusion. Image goes up top, gif comes out bottom.

# Requirements

torch - If you are on windows go use the pytorch install command configurator on the website or else you wont have gpu acceleration
tkinter
customtkinter
opencv-python (maybe its still in my env but might not be needed anymore, still learning tkinter shit)
diffusers
transformers
pillow
probably some other shit I forgot, if it whines about a missing library when you go to run it, just install it.
